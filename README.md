Verilog Safety Monitoring System

## Objective

A system is designed that is there to regulate
the school system and provides automated
assistance to both the school and other
external services with regards to security and
weather.

## Project Goals

Creating a functioning code, and Designing a
functional system using Verilog and FPGA
boards to stimulate a real world solution

## Methodology

 - Sources were used to collect information on
what the system would contain (security
services and school officials) and was then
designed with automatic inputs to move to
whatever required stages any situation
would need.

 - Contacted Experts in the associated field of
school safety

## Results

- The system reacts how it was programed
with each stages functioning properly
stimulating a automated assistance with
respect to weather and security.

## Conclusions
 - While currently installing all these
systems currently seems impractical due to
existing school budgets it would be a
great assistance to schools.

- The idea is completely doable with
current technology; however, in
practicality, current systems are
manageable, but not ideal.
